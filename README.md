## TODOS

1. Pass query to handler from view not fetch from controller for pagination.
2. in dropdown show total number of results e.g. View All (892)
3. Make movie detail functionality

- implemented for movie list item click, do the same for search dropdown item click.

4. Don't remove dropdown movies. Just hide them, when user refocus input show them
